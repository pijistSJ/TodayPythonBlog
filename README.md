# TodayPythonBlog
~~~
I am starting this python blog which is completely related to Python(programming language)
~~~
<hr style="height:5.5px ;background: linear-gradient(315deg, #fff700 0% ,#FF3F00 75%);"/>

I am not a complete professional or something, just another student in field, also this will help me keep track of my learnings , which i might eventually forget so...
<br>  <br>
this blog will probably include everything i come across new in my daily life
<br>  <br>
Also this is a blog in no perticular order so i suggest if you're begginer , don't expect to learn basic python from this blog-series
